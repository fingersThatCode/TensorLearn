# **TensorLearn**
Here I will be using TensorFlow framework to build several neural networks and explore more advanced techniques like natural language processing and reinforcement learning.

TensorFlow is an open source framework that makes machine learning and neural networking easier to use
outcome
how deep, 
recurrent, 
and convolutional neural networks works.
